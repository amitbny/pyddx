The finite difference method is a robust and easily implemented method for numerical solutions of partial differential equations in simple domains. Finite difference derivatives can be implemented efficiently as sparse matrices acting on dense vectors. Pyddx provides a collection of finite difference derivative matrices in one, two and three space dimensions, based on standard stencils and stencils derived from lattice kinetic theory.
